* Bugs:
** BeautifulSoup current doesn't work.
   BeautifulSoup==3.0.7a does.
** Wordpress converter outputs pages in addition to posts
** Trackbacks with disqus don't work
   does Wordpress use it's own trackback system and call some undocumented API?

* Todo:
** Add draft support
   should allow posts inside of the _drafts folder to be processed but not put into the chronological blog nor in any of the feeds
   the only way to access the post should be through the permalink.
** Integrate geshi syntax highlighting
** Add markdown support
