Blogofile is released both under an MIT style license as well as to the
public domain directly. The two methods are virtually identical excepting the
MIT licence's requirement for copyright and licence republication, both of which
will not be enforced by Ryan McGuire in a legal setting.

Any contributors to Blogofile understand that they relinquish their code to be 
released under the MIT license as well as to the public domain.

### Public Domain Statement
################################################################################

I believe in free software. For me, this also means that I do not believe in
copyrights, trademarks, patents, nor any other government enforced monopoly
privilege. Accordingly, this software claims none of these privileges and is
released to the public domain.

You probably downloaded this software from my website. By doing so, you did not
first enter into any sort of agreement or contract with me. There were no rules
established before you downloaded it -- I simply offered the file on my website
and you simply downloaded it. I am not your master -- it is immoral for me to use
any (initiated) force against you, including the force of government.

This software is now completely yours to do with as you please.

However, I am a human being. I enjoy praise, attribution, and other rewards for
my work. If you find this software useful, I appreciate comments to that effect.
If you find this software _very_ useful, I appreciate gifts. If you make useful
modifications to this software, I appreciate patches. If you incorporate this
software into a product of your own, I like to know about it, and I like being
mentioned in your product's documentation or website. But again, I am not your
master -- It is wrong for me to force you to do anything. I can only ask.
