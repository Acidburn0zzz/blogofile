Blogofile is a simple blog engine that requires no database and no
special hosting environment.
You customize a set of templates with Mako,
create posts in a markup language like
reStrucuturedText, Markdown, or Textile, (or even plain HTML)
and Blogofile generates your entire blog as
plain HTML, CSS, images, and Atom/RSS feeds
which you can then upload to any old web server you like.
No CGI or scripting environment is needed on the server.

See the `main blogofile website`_ for usage instructions.
